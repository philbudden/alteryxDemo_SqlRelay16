# Scenario:

You work at Twitter HQ in San Francisco.  On your way home you plan to go Pokemon hunting.  You live North West of your office and only plan to search within a 2-mile radius.  You're hoping to find a good all-rounder with a fair attack and defence.  You're also hoping for a Pokemon that none of your friends have so it can't be a creature that spawns frequently.  In order to maximise your chances you've decided to use Data and Alteryx.

This demonstration will show some of the Data Prep, Blending, Statistical & Spatial Analysis and Reporting tools available with Alteryx Designer.

These datasets are available in CSV format from Kaggle at:

They are also available, along with the demonstration workflow, from GitHub at http://bit.ly/2cWoGI2
